     METHOD      is a short string providing parameters defining
                 the computation method to be used. In the syntax
                 descriptions below, items delimited by brackets
                 are optional.
                
                 METHOD may be assigned the following values:   

                    'ELLIPSOID'
 
                       The intercept computation uses a triaxial
                       ellipsoid to model the surface of the target
                       body. The ellipsoid's radii must be available
                       in the kernel pool.


                    'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                       The intercept computation uses topographic data
                       to model the surface of the target body. These
                       data must be provided by loaded DSK files.

                       The surface list specification is optional. The
                       syntax of the list is

                          &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                       If present, it indicates that data only for the
                       listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                       need not be available for all surfaces in the
                       list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                       associated with the target body are used.

                       The surface list may contain surface names or
                       surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                       be delimited by double quotes, for example

                          SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;
                                         
                       If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                       or IDs must be separated by commas.

                       See the Particulars section below for details
                       concerning use of DSK data.


                 Neither case nor white space are significant in
                 METHOD, except within double-quoted strings. For
                 example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is valid.

                 Within double-quoted strings, blank characters are
                 significant, but multiple consecutive blanks are
                 considered equivalent to a single blank. Case is 
                 not significant. So

                    &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                 is equivalent to 

                    &quot; mars megdr  128  pixel/deg &quot;

                 but not to

                    &quot;MARS MEGDR128PIXEL/DEG&quot;
 
                 
     TARGET      is the name of the target body. TARGET is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code 
                 for the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301'
                 are legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
                 target body.

                 When the target body's surface is represented by a
                 tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a
                 kernel variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is
                 present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel
                 variable would be defined by loading a PCK file.


     ET          is the epoch of participation of the observer,
                 expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: ET is
                 the epoch at which the observer's state is computed.

                 When aberration corrections are not used, ET is also
                 the epoch at which the state and orientation of the
                 target body are computed.

                 When aberration corrections are used, the position
                 and orientation of the target body are computed at
                 ET-LT or ET+LT, where LT is the one-way light time
                 between the intercept point and the observer, and the
                 sign applied to LT depends on the selected
                 correction. See the description of ABCORR below for
                 details.

                                  
     FIXREF      is the name of a body-fixed reference frame centered
                 on the target body. FIXREF may be any such frame
                 supported by the SPICE system, including built-in
                 frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading)
                 and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK). The
                 string FIXREF is case-insensitive, and leading and
                 trailing blanks in FIXREF are not significant.

                 The output intercept point SPOINT and the observer-to-
                 intercept vector SRFVEC will be expressed relative to
                 this reference frame.


     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                 when computing the target's position and orientation.

                 For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                 surface intercept point seen by the observer is
                 desired, normally the correction
              
                    'CN+S'
     
                 should be used. This and the other supported options
                 are described below. ABCORR may be any of the 
                 following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the 
                               geometric surface intercept point on the
                               target body.

                 Let LT represent the one-way light time between the
                 observer and the surface intercept point (note: NOT
                 between the observer and the target body's center).
                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 intercept point's location at the light-time
                 corrected epoch ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's
                 location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the location of the surface
                               intercept point at the moment it
                               emitted photons arriving at the
                               observer at ET.
 
                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation. The solution invoked by the
                               'LT' option uses one iteration.

                               Both the target position as seen by the
                               observer, and rotation of the target
                               body, are corrected for light time.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               surface intercept obtained with the
                               'LT' option to account for the
                               observer's velocity relative to the
                               solar system barycenter. These
                               computations yield the apparent surface
                               intercept point.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges. Both the
                               position and rotation of the target
                               body are corrected for light time.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time and
                               stellar aberration corrections. This
                               option produces a solution that is at
                               least as accurate at that obtainable
                               with the 'LT+S' option. Whether the
                               'CN+S' solution is substantially more
                               accurate depends on the geometry of the
                               participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed.

                               For reception-case applications
                               involving intercepts near the target
                               body limb, this option should be used.

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 intercept point at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               intercept location at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET. 

                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation. The solution invoked by the
                               'XLT' option uses one iteration.

                               Both the target position as seen by the
                               observer, and rotation of the target
                               body, are corrected for light time.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               intercept obtained with the 'XLT'
                               option to account for the observer's
                               velocity relative to the solar system
                               barycenter.

                    'XCN'      Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. This is the same as XLT
                               correction but with further iterations
                               to a converged Newtonian light time
                               solution. 

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                               Newtonian light time and stellar
                               aberration corrections. This option
                               produces a solution that is at least as
                               accurate at that obtainable with the
                               'XLT+S' option. Whether the 'XCN+S'
                               solution is substantially more accurate
                               depends on the geometry of the
                               participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed.

                               For transmission-case applications
                               involving intercepts near the target
                               body limb, this option should be used.

                Case and embedded blanks are not significant in
                ABCORR. For example, the string

                   'Cn + s'

                 is valid.


     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body. This is typically
                 a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the
                 earth. OBSRVR is case-insensitive, and leading and
                 trailing blanks in OBSRVR are not significant.
                 Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
                 integer ID code for the object. For example both
                 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
                 the Moon is the observer.


     DREF        is the name of the reference frame relative to which
                 the ray's direction vector is expressed. This may be
                 any frame supported by the SPICE system, including
                 built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required
                 Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel
                 (FK). The string DREF is case-insensitive, and
                 leading and trailing blanks in DREF are not
                 significant.

                 When DREF designates a non-inertial frame, the
                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
                 dependent on the frame's center and, if the center is
                 not the observer, on the selected aberration
                 correction. See the description of the direction
                 vector DVEC for details.


     DVEC        Ray direction vector emanating from the observer. The
                 intercept with the target body's surface of the ray
                 defined by the observer and DVEC is sought.

                 DVEC is specified relative to the reference frame
                 designated by DREF.

                 Non-inertial reference frames are treated as follows:
                 if the center of the frame is at the observer's
                 location, the frame is evaluated at ET. If the
                 frame's center is located elsewhere, then letting
                 LTCENT be the one-way light time between the observer
                 and the central body associated with the frame, the
                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at ET-LTCENT,
                 ET+LTCENT, or ET depending on whether the requested
                 aberration correction is, respectively, for received
                 radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
                 LTCENT is computed using the method indicated by
                 ABCORR.

     SPOINT      is the surface intercept point on the target body of
                 the ray defined by the observer and the direction
                 vector. If the ray intersects the target body in
                 multiple points, the selected intersection point is
                 the one closest to the observer. The output argument
                 FOUND (see below) indicates whether an intercept was
                 found.

                 SPOINT is expressed in Cartesian coordinates,
                 relative to the target body-fixed frame designated by
                 FIXREF. The body-fixed target frame is evaluated at
                 the intercept epoch TRGEPC (see description below).

                 When light time correction is used, the duration of
                 light travel between SPOINT to the observer is
                 considered to be the one way light time. When both
                 light time and stellar aberration corrections are
                 used, SPOINT is compute such that, when the vector
                 from the observer to SPOINT is corrected for light
                 time and stellar aberration, the resulting vector
                 lies on the ray defined by the observer's location
                 and DVEC.

                 The components of SPOINT are given in units of km.


     TRGEPC      is the &quot;intercept epoch.&quot; TRGEPC is defined as
                 follows: letting LT be the one-way light time between
                 the observer and the intercept point, TRGEPC is the
                 epoch ET-LT, ET+LT, or ET depending on whether the
                 requested aberration correction is, respectively, for
                 received radiation, transmitted radiation, or
                 omitted. LT is computed using the method indicated by
                 ABCORR.

                 TRGEPC is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.


     SRFVEC      is the vector from the observer's position at ET to
                 the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
                 position of SPOINT, where the aberration corrections
                 are specified by ABCORR. SRFVEC is expressed in the
                 target body-fixed reference frame designated by
                 FIXREF, evaluated at TRGEPC.
  
                 The components of SRFVEC are given in units of km.

                 One can use the SPICELIB function <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> to obtain the
                 distance between the observer and SPOINT:

                    DIST = <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> ( SRFVEC )

                 The observer's position OBSPOS, relative to the
                 target body's center, where the center's position is
                 corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
                 ABCORR, can be computed via the call:

                    CALL <a href="vsub.html">VSUB</a> ( SPOINT, SRFVEC, OBSPOS )

                 To transform the vector SRFVEC from a reference frame
                 FIXREF at time TRGEPC to a time-dependent reference
                 frame REF at time ET, the routine <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> should be
                 called. Let XFORM be the 3x3 matrix representing the
                 rotation from the reference frame FIXREF at time
                 TRGEPC to the reference frame REF at time ET. Then
                 SRFVEC can be transformed to the result REFVEC as
                 follows:

                     CALL <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> ( FIXREF, REF,    TRGEPC, ET, XFORM )
                     CALL <a href="mxv.html">MXV</a>    ( XFORM,  SRFVEC, REFVEC )

                 The second example in the Examples header section
                 below presents a complete program that demonstrates
                 this procedure.
     

     FOUND       A logical flag indicating whether or not the ray
                 intersects the target. If an intersection exists
                 FOUND will be returned as .TRUE. If the ray misses
                 the target, FOUND will be returned as .FALSE.

     1)  If the specified aberration correction is unrecognized, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be
         converted to an integer ID code, the error
         SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled.

     3)  If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID code,
         the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled.

     4)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not
         recognized, the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame
         name may fail to be recognized because a required frame
         specification kernel has not been loaded; another cause is a
         misspelling of the frame name.

     5)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body,
         the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled.

     6)  If the input argument METHOD cannot be parsed, the error
         is signaled either by this routine or by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     7)  If the target and observer have distinct identities but are
         at the same location (for example, the target is Mars and the
         observer is the Mars barycenter), the error
         SPICE(NOSEPARATION) is signaled.

     8)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
         calling <b>SINCPT</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when
         light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must
         be available to propagate the states of both observer and
         target to the solar system barycenter.

     9)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target
         shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been
         loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>SINCPT</b>, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     10) The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of
         the target body are non-positive, the error will be
         diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     11) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame
         orientation have not been loaded prior to calling <b>SINCPT</b>,
         the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     12) If the reference frame designated by DREF is not recognized
         by the SPICE frame subsystem, the error SPICE(NOFRAME)
         will be signaled.

     13) If the direction vector DVEC is the zero vector, the error
         SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) will be signaled.

     14) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented by
         DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified
         target, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.
         
     15) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented
         by DSK data, and DSK data are not available for a portion of 
         the target body's surface, an intercept might not be found.
         This routine does not revert to using an ellipsoidal surface
         in this case.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer must be
          loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
          must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
          Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
          or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: if the computation method is specified as
          &quot;Ellipsoid,&quot; triaxial radii for the target body must be 
          loaded into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by
          loading a text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must
          be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK
          file. 

     The following data may be required:

        - DSK data: if METHOD indicates that DSK data are to be used,
          DSK files containing topographic data for the target body
          must be loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for
          at least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded.

        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
          in METHOD, the association of these names with their
          corresponding surface ID codes must be established by 
          assignments of the kernel variables

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

          Normally these associations are made by loading a text
          kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
          of such an assignment is

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1                    
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert
          the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of
          the target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Similarly, the frame definition required to map
          between the frame designated by DREF and the target
          body-fixed frame must be available. Typically the
          definitions of frames not already built-in to SPICE are
          supplied by loading a frame kernel.

        - CK data: if the frame to which DREF refers is fixed to a
          spacecraft instrument or structure, at least one CK file
          will be needed to permit transformation of vectors between
          that frame and both the J2000 and the target body-fixed
          frames.

        - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

<PRE>
     Given a ray defined by a direction vector and the location of an
     observer, <b>SINCPT</b> computes the surface intercept point of the ray
     on a specified target body. <b>SINCPT</b> also determines the vector
     from the observer to the surface intercept point. If the ray
     intersects the target in multiple locations, the intercept
     closest to the observer is selected.

     When aberration corrections are used, this routine finds the
     value of SPOINT such that, if SPOINT is regarded as an ephemeris
     object, after the selected aberration corrections are applied to
     the vector from the observer to SPOINT, the resulting vector is
     parallel to the direction vector DVEC.

     This routine computes light time corrections using light time
     between the observer and the surface intercept point, as opposed
     to the center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration
     corrections done by this routine are based on the direction of
     the vector from the observer to the light-time corrected
     intercept point, not to the target center. This technique avoids
     errors due to the differential between aberration corrections
     across the target body. Therefore it's valid to use aberration
     corrections with this routine even when the observer is very
     close to the intercept point, in particular when the
     observer-intercept point distance is much less than the
     observer-target center distance. It's also valid to use stellar
     aberration corrections even when the intercept point is near or
     on the limb (as may occur in occultation computations using a
     point target).

     When comparing surface intercept point computations with results
     from sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the
     same geometric definitions are used.


     Using DSK data
     ==============

        DSK loading and unloading
        -------------------------

        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
        calling <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload.html">UNLOAD</a> or
        <a href="kclear.html">KCLEAR</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> for limits on numbers
        of loaded DSK files.

        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
        given body have different surface ID codes.


        DSK data priority
        -----------------

        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
        intervals of the segments overlap as well.

        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
        segment located closer to the end of the file takes
        precedence.

        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the
        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
        surface. 

        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
        required in the METHOD argument.

        
        Syntax of the METHOD input argument
        -----------------------------------

        The keywords and surface list in the METHOD argument
        are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any
        order, for example

           DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED
           DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;
           UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK

        The simplest form of the METHOD argument specifying use of
        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

           'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
        segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
        the usual case.

        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
        surfaces are to be used together.

        The surface list consists of the string

           SURFACES =

        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
        names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

           Surface Name                              ID code
           ------------                              -------
           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1
           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2
           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3

        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
        data for surface 1 can be specified by either

           'SURFACES = 1'

        or

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
        it contains blank characters. 
           
        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
        of the following surface lists could be used:

           'SURFACES = 2, 3'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'
         
        An example of a METHOD argument that could be constructed
        using one of the surface lists above is

           'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'


        Round-off errors and mitigating algorithms
        ------------------------------------------

        When topographic data are used to represent the surface of a
        target body, round-off errors can produce some results that
        may seem surprising.

        Note that, since the surface in question might have mountains,
        valleys, and cliffs, the points of intersection found for
        nearly identical sets of inputs may be quite far apart from
        each other: for example, a ray that hits a mountain side in a
        nearly tangent fashion may, on a different host computer, be
        found to miss the mountain and hit a valley floor much farther
        from the observer, or even miss the target altogether.
        
        Round-off errors can affect segment selection: for example, a
        ray that is expected to intersect the target body's surface
        near the boundary between two segments might hit either
        segment, or neither of them; the result may be
        platform-dependent.

        A similar situation exists when a surface is modeled by a set
        of triangular plates, and the ray is expected to intersect the
        surface near a plate boundary.
        
        To avoid having the routine fail to find an intersection when
        one clearly should exist, this routine uses two &quot;greedy&quot;
        algorithms:
       
           1) If the ray passes sufficiently close to any of the 
              boundary surfaces of a segment (for example, surfaces of
              maximum and minimum longitude or latitude), that segment
              is tested for an intersection of the ray with the
              surface represented by the segment's data.

              This choice prevents all of the segments from being
              missed when at least one should be hit, but it could, on
              rare occasions, cause an intersection to be found in a
              segment other than the one that would be found if higher
              precision arithmetic were used.
              
           2) For type 2 segments, which represent surfaces as 
              sets of triangular plates, each plate is expanded very
              slightly before a ray-plate intersection test is
              performed. The default plate expansion factor is 

                 1 + 1.E-10

              In other words, the sides of the plate are lengthened by
              1/10 of a micron per km. The expansion keeps the centroid
              of the plate fixed.

              Plate expansion prevents all plates from being missed
              in cases where clearly at least one should be hit.

              As with the greedy segment selection algorithm, plate
              expansion can occasionally cause an intercept to be
              found on a different plate than would be found if higher
              precision arithmetic were used. It also can occasionally
              cause an intersection to be found when the ray misses
              the target by a very small distance. 

         
        Aberration corrections
        ----------------------

        For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the
        observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a
        continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time
        between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as
        well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found
        using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at
        all. In all cases, the light time computation will terminate,
        but the result may be less accurate than expected.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 


     1) The following program computes surface intercept points on Mars
        for the boresight and FOV boundary vectors of the MGS MOC
        narrow angle camera. The intercepts are computed for a single
        observation epoch. Light time and stellar aberration
        corrections are used. For simplicity, camera distortion is
        ignored.

        Intercepts are computed using both triaxial ellipsoid and 
        topographic surface models. 

        The topographic model is based on data from the MGS MOLA DEM
        megr90n000cb, which has a resolution of 4 pixels/degree. A
        triangular plate model was produced by computing a 720 x 1440
        grid of interpolated heights from this DEM, then tessellating
        the height grid. The plate model is stored in a type 2 segment
        in the referenced DSK file.

     2) Use <a href="subpnt.html">SUBPNT</a> to find the sub-spacecraft point on Mars for the
        Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft (MRO) at a specified
        time, using the &quot;near point: ellipsoid&quot; computation method.
        Use both LT+S and CN+S aberration corrections to illustrate
        the differences.

        Convert the spacecraft to sub-observer point vector obtained
        from <a href="subpnt.html">SUBPNT</a> into the MRO_HIRISE_LOOK_DIRECTION reference frame
        at the observation time. Perform a consistency check with this
        vector: compare the Mars surface intercept of the ray
        emanating from the spacecraft and pointed along this vector
        with the sub-observer point.

        Perform the sub-observer point and surface intercept
        computations using both triaxial ellipsoid and topographic
        surface models. 

        For this example, the topographic model is based on the MGS
        MOLA DEM megr90n000eb, which has a resolution of 16
        pixels/degree. Eight DSKs, each covering longitude and
        latitude ranges of 90 degrees, were made from this data set.
        For the region covered by a given DSK, a grid of approximately
        1500 x 1500 interpolated heights was produced, and this grid
        was tessellated using approximately 4.5 million triangular
        plates, giving a total plate count of about 36 million for the
        entire DSK set.

        All DSKs in the set use the surface ID code 499001, so there
        is no need to specify the surface ID in the METHOD strings
        passed to <b>SINCPT</b> and <a href="subpnt.html">SUBPNT</a>.

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>
<PRE>
     A cautionary note: if aberration corrections are used, and 
     if DREF is the target body-fixed frame, the epoch at which that
     frame is evaluated is offset from ET by the light time between
     the observer and the *center* of the target body. This light time
     normally will differ from the light time between the observer and
     intercept point. Consequently the orientation of the target
     body-fixed frame at TRGEPC will not match that of the target
     body-fixed frame at the epoch associated with DREF. As a result,
     various derived quantities may not be as expected: for example,
     SRFVEC would not be parallel to DVEC.

     In many applications the errors arising from this frame
     discrepancy may be insignificant; however a safe approach is to
     always use as DREF a frame other than the target body-fixed
     frame.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 04-APR-2017 (NJB)

       01-FEB-2016 (NJB)

        Upgraded to support surfaces represented by DSKs. 

        Updated kernels are used in header example programs.
     
    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 31-MAR-2014 (NJB) (SCK) (BVS)

        Bug fix: FIRST is now set to .FALSE. at the completion
        of a successful initialization pass. This does not affect
        the routine's outputs but improves efficiency.

        Bug fix: redundant call to <a href="spkssb.html">SPKSSB</a> was removed. This does not
        affect the routine's outputs but improves efficiency.

        References to the new <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> routine were added, which changed
        the Detailed Output section and the second example. Some header
        comment corrections were made.

        Upgrade: this routine now uses ZZVALCOR rather than
        ZZPRSCOR, simplifying the implementation.

        Upgrade: this routine now saves the input body names and
        ZZBODTRN state counters and does name-ID conversions only if
        the counters have changed.

        Upgrade: this routine now saves the input frame names and <a href="pool.html">POOL</a>
        state counters and does frame name-ID conversions only if the
        counters have changed.

    SPICELIB Version 1.2.0, 07-APR-2010 (NJB)

        Code style improvement: re-use of variables in 
        <a href="frinfo.html">FRINFO</a> calls has been eliminated. There is no impact 
        of the behavior of the routine.

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 17-MAR-2009 (NJB)(EDW) 

        Bug fix: quick test for non-intersection is
        no longer performed when observer-target distance
        is less than target's maximum radius.

        Typos in the Detailed Input section's description of DREF
        were corrected.

        In the header examples, meta-kernel names were updated to use
        the suffix 

           &quot;.tm&quot;

        Incorrect frame name FIXFRM was changed to FIXREF in
        documentation.

        Typo correction in Required_Reading, changed FRAME 
        to FRAMES.
