     METHOD      is a short string providing parameters defining
                 the computation method to be used. In the syntax
                 descriptions below, items delimited by brackets
                 are optional.
                
                 METHOD may be assigned the following values:   

                    'ELLIPSOID'
 
                       The illumination angle computation uses a
                       triaxial ellipsoid to model the surface of the
                       target body. The ellipsoid's radii must be
                       available in the kernel pool.


                    'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                       The illumination angle computation uses
                       topographic data to model the surface of the
                       target body. These data must be provided by
                       loaded DSK files.

                       The surface list specification is optional. The
                       syntax of the list is

                          &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                       If present, it indicates that data only for the
                       listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                       need not be available for all surfaces in the
                       list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                       associated with the target body are used.

                       The surface list may contain surface names or
                       surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                       be delimited by double quotes, for example

                          SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;
                                         
                       If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                       or IDs must be separated by commas.

                       See the Particulars section below for details
                       concerning use of DSK data.


                 Neither case nor white space are significant in
                 METHOD, except within double-quoted strings. For
                 example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is valid.

                 Within double-quoted strings, blank characters are
                 significant, but multiple consecutive blanks are
                 considered equivalent to a single blank. Case is 
                 not significant. So

                    &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                 is equivalent to 

                    &quot; mars megdr  128  pixel/deg &quot;

                 but not to

                    &quot;MARS MEGDR128PIXEL/DEG&quot;


     TARGET      is the name of the target body. TARGET is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 TARGET are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
                 target body.


     ILUSRC      is the name of the illumination source. This source
                 may be any ephemeris object. Case, blanks, and
                 numeric values are treated in the same way as for the
                 input TARGET.
                 

     ET          is the epoch, expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB,
                 for which the apparent illumination angles at the
                 specified surface point on the target body, as seen
                 from the observing body, are to be computed.


     FIXREF      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered
                 reference frame associated with the target body. The
                 input surface point SPOINT and the output vector
                 SRFVEC are expressed relative to this reference
                 frame. The string FIXREF is case-insensitive, and
                 leading and trailing blanks in FIXREF are not
                 significant.


     ABCORR      is the aberration correction to be used in computing
                 the position and orientation of the target body and
                 the location of the illumination source.
         
                 For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                 illumination angles seen by the observer are desired,
                 normally either of the corrections 
              
                    'LT+S' 
                    'CN+S'
     
                 should be used. These and the other supported options
                 are described below. ABCORR may be any of the 
                 following:

                    'NONE'     No aberration correction.

                 Let LT represent the one-way light time between the
                 observer and SPOINT (note: NOT between the observer
                 and the target body's center). The following values
                 of ABCORR apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in which
                 photons depart from SPOINT at the light-time
                 corrected epoch ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's
                 location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct both the position of SPOINT as
                               seen by the observer, and the position
                               of the illumination source as seen by
                               the target, for light time. Correct the
                               orientation of the target for light
                               time.

                    'LT+S'     Correct both the position of SPOINT as
                               seen by the observer, and the position
                               of the illumination source as seen by
                               the target, for light time and stellar
                               aberration. Correct the orientation of
                               the target for light time.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equations for target and the
                               illumination source, the &quot;CN&quot;
                               correction iterates until the solution
                               converges.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time and
                               stellar aberration corrections. This
                               option produces a solution that is at
                               least as accurate at that obtainable
                               with the 'LT+S' option. Whether the
                               'CN+S' solution is substantially more
                               accurate depends on the geometry of the
                               participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed.

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *arrive* at
                 SPOINT at the light-time corrected epoch ET+LT and
                 *depart* from the observer's location at ET:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               illumination angles at the moment that
                               SPOINT receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET. 

                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation. The solution invoked by the
                               'XLT' option uses one iteration.

                               Both the target position as seen by the
                               observer, and rotation of the target
                               body, are corrected for light time.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               angles obtained with the 'XLT' option
                               to account for the observer's and
                               target's velocities relative to the
                               solar system barycenter (the latter
                               velocity is used in computing the
                               direction to the apparent illumination
                               source).

                    'XCN'      Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. This is the same as XLT
                               correction but with further iterations
                               to a converged Newtonian light time
                               solution. 

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                               Newtonian light time and stellar
                               aberration corrections. This option
                               produces a solution that is at least as
                               accurate at that obtainable with the
                               'XLT+S' option. Whether the 'XCN+S'
                               solution is substantially more accurate
                               depends on the geometry of the
                               participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed.


                 Neither case nor white space are significant in
                 ABCORR. For example, the string 

                   'Lt + s'

                 is valid.
                               

     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body. The observing body
                 is an ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft,
                 the earth, or a surface point on the earth. OBSRVR is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 OBSRVR are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
                 observer.

                 OBSRVR may be not be identical to TARGET.


     SPOINT      is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
                 Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-fixed
                 target frame designated by FIXREF.

                 SPOINT need not be visible from the observer's
                 location at the epoch ET.

                 The components of SPOINT have units of km.

     TRGEPC      is the &quot;surface point epoch.&quot; TRGEPC is defined as
                 follows: letting LT be the one-way light time between
                 the observer and the input surface point SPOINT,
                 TRGEPC is either the epoch ET-LT or ET depending on
                 whether the requested aberration correction is,
                 respectively, for received radiation or omitted. LT
                 is computed using the method indicated by ABCORR.

                 TRGEPC is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.


     SRFVEC      is the vector from the observer's position at ET to
                 the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
                 position of SPOINT, where the aberration corrections
                 are specified by ABCORR. SRFVEC is expressed in the
                 target body-fixed reference frame designated by
                 FIXREF, evaluated at TRGEPC.
  
                 The components of SRFVEC are given in units of km.

                 One can use the SPICELIB function <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> to obtain the
                 distance between the observer and SPOINT:

                    DIST = <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> ( SRFVEC )

                 The observer's position OBSPOS, relative to the
                 target body's center, where the center's position is
                 corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
                 ABCORR, can be computed via the call:

                    CALL <a href="vsub.html">VSUB</a> ( SPOINT, SRFVEC, OBSPOS )

                 To transform the vector SRFVEC to a time-dependent
                 reference frame REF at ET, a sequence of calls is
                 required. For example, let XFORM be 3x3 matrix
                 describing the transformation between the target
                 body-fixed frame at TRGEPC to the time-dependent
                 frame REF at ET. Then SRFVEC can be transformed to
                 the result REFVEC as follows:

                     CALL <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> ( FIXREF, REF,    TRGEPC, ET, XFORM )
                     CALL <a href="mxv.html">MXV</a>    ( XFORM,  SRFVEC, REFVEC )


     PHASE       is the phase angle at SPOINT, as seen from OBSRVR at
                 time ET. This is the angle between the negative of
                 the vector SRFVEC and the SPOINT-source vector at
                 TRGEPC. Units are radians. The range of PHASE is
                 [0, pi].  

     INCDNC      is the illumination source incidence angle at SPOINT,
                 as seen from OBSRVR at time ET. This is the angle
                 between the surface normal vector at SPOINT and the
                 SPOINT-source vector at TRGEPC. Units are radians.
                 The range of INCDNC is [0, pi].

     EMISSN      is the emission angle at SPOINT, as seen from OBSRVR
                 at time ET. This is the angle between the surface
                 normal vector at SPOINT and the negative of the
                 vector SRFVEC. Units are radians. The range of EMISSN
                 is [0, pi].

     1)  If the specified aberration correction is relativistic or
         calls for stellar aberration but not light time correction,
         the error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. If the specified
         aberration correction is any other unrecognized value, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     2)  If any of the target, observer, or illumination source 
         input strings cannot be converted to an integer ID code, the
         error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled.

     3)  If OBSRVR and TARGET map to the same NAIF integer ID code,
         the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled.

     4)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not
         recognized, the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame
         name may fail to be recognized because a required frame
         specification kernel has not been loaded; another cause is a
         misspelling of the frame name.

     5)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body,
         the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled.

     6)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled.

     7)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
         calling <b>ILLUMG</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when
         light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must
         be available to propagate the states of observer, target, and
         the illumination source to the solar system barycenter.

     8)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target
         shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been
         loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>ILLUMG</b>, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     9)  The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of
         the target body are non-positive, the error will be
         diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call tree of this
         routine.

     10) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame
         orientation have not been loaded prior to calling <b>ILLUMG</b>,
         the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     11) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented by
         DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified
         target, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.
         
     12) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented
         by DSK data, and data representing the portion of the surface
         on which SPOINT is located are not available, an error will 
         be signaled by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     13) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented
         by DSK data, SPOINT must lie on the target surface, not above
         or below it. A small tolerance is used to allow for round-off
         error in the calculation determining whether SPOINT is on the
         surface. If, in the DSK case, SPOINT is too far from the
         surface, an error will be signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

         If the surface is represented by a triaxial ellipsoid, SPOINT
         is not required to be close to the ellipsoid; however, the
         results computed by this routine will be unreliable if SPOINT
         is too far from the ellipsoid.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and the
          illumination source must be loaded. If aberration
          corrections are used, the states of target, observer, and
          the illumination source relative to the solar system
          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading
          one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be
          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.

        - Shape data for the target body:
                
            PCK data: 

               If the target body shape is modeled as an ellipsoid,
               triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded into
               the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
               text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

               Triaxial radii are also needed if the target shape is
               modeled by DSK data, but the DSK NADIR method is
               selected.

            DSK data: 

               If the target shape is modeled by DSK data, DSK files
               containing topographic data for the target body must be
               loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for at
               least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded.

     The following data may be required:

        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the
          observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the
          target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
          frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
          in METHOD, the association of these names with their
          corresponding surface ID codes must be established by 
          assignments of the kernel variables

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

          Normally these associations are made by loading a text
          kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
          of such an assignment is

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1  
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499                  

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

     Illumination angles
     ===================

     The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to the following set of
     angles:


        phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                                 surface point to the observer and
                                 from the surface point to the 
                                 illumination source.

        incidence angle          Angle between the surface normal at
                                 the specified surface point and the
                                 vector from the surface point to the
                                 illumination source.

        emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                                 the specified surface point and the
                                 vector from the surface point to the
                                 observer.
 
     The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships
     defining these angles. The labels for the incidence, emission,
     and phase angles are &quot;inc.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.


                                                      *
                                              illumination source

      location           to viewing
      (observer)         location


     Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
     at the surface point, and the target-illumination source vector
     are coplanar, then phase is the sum of the incidence and emission
     angles. This rarely occurs; usually

        phase angle  &lt;  incidence angle + emission angle

     All of the above angles can be computed using light time
     corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or no
     aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent geometry as
     observed by a remote sensing instrument, both light time and
     stellar aberration corrections should be used.
     
     The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine
     is described below.

        Light time corrections
        ======================

           Observer-target surface point vector
           ------------------------------------

           Let ET be the epoch at which an observation or remote
           sensing measurement is made, and let ET - LT (&quot;LT&quot; stands
           for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons
           received at ET were emitted from the surface point SPOINT.
           Note that the light time between the surface point and
           observer will generally differ from the light time between
           the target body's center and the observer.


           Target body's orientation
           -------------------------

           Using the definitions of ET and LT above, the target body's
           orientation at ET - LT is used. The surface normal is
           dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's
           orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch.


           Target body -- illumination source vector
           -----------------------------------------

           The surface features on the target body near SPOINT will
           appear in a measurement made at ET as they were at ET-LT.
           In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
           the apparent location of the illumination source as seen
           from the target body at ET-LT. So, a second light time
           correction is used to compute the position of the
           illumination source relative to the surface point.


        Stellar aberration corrections
        ==============================

        Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if
        light time corrections are applied as well.

           Observer-target surface point body vector
           -----------------------------------------

           When stellar aberration correction is performed, the
           direction vector SRFVEC is adjusted so as to point to the
           apparent position of SPOINT: considering SPOINT to be an
           ephemeris object, SRFVEC points from the observer's
           position at ET to the light time and stellar aberration
           corrected position of SPOINT.

           Target body-illumination source vector
           --------------------------------------

           The target body-illumination source vector is the apparent
           position of the illumination source, corrected for light
           time and stellar aberration, as seen from the target body
           at time ET-LT.


     Using DSK data
     ==============

        DSK loading and unloading
        -------------------------

        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
        calling <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload.html">UNLOAD</a> or
        <a href="kclear.html">KCLEAR</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> for limits on numbers
        of loaded DSK files.

        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
        given body have different surface ID codes.


        DSK data priority
        -----------------

        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
        intervals of the segments overlap as well.

        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
        segment located closer to the end of the file takes
        precedence.

        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the
        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
        surface. 

        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
        required in the METHOD argument.

        
        Syntax of the METHOD input argument
        -----------------------------------

        The keywords and surface list in the METHOD argument
        are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any
        order, for example

           DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED
           DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;
           UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK

        The simplest form of the METHOD argument specifying use of
        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

           'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
        segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
        the usual case.

        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
        surfaces are to be used together.

        The surface list consists of the string

           SURFACES =

        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
        names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

           Surface Name                              ID code
           ------------                              -------
           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1
           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2
           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3

        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
        data for surface 1 can be specified by either

           'SURFACES = 1'

        or

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
        it contains blank characters. 
           
        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
        of the following surface lists could be used:

           'SURFACES = 2, 3'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'
         
        An example of a METHOD argument that could be constructed
        using one of the surface lists above is

              'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = '
           // '&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'


        Aberration corrections using DSK data
        -------------------------------------

        For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the
        observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a
        continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time
        between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as
        well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found
        using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at
        all. In all cases, the light time computation will terminate,
        but the result may be less accurate than expected.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
     input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine 
     specific arithmetic implementation. 

     1) Find the phase, solar incidence, and emission angles at the
        sub-solar and sub-spacecraft points on Mars as seen from the
        Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft at a specified UTC time. Use
        light time and stellar aberration corrections.

        Use both an ellipsoidal Mars shape model and topographic data
        provided by a DSK file.

        kernels.
