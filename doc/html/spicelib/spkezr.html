<h4><a name="Detailed_Input">Detailed_Input</a></h4>
<PRE>
     TARG        is the name of a target body. Optionally, you may
                 supply the integer ID code for the object as
                 an integer string. For example both 'MOON' and
                 '301' are legitimate strings that indicate the
                 moon is the target body.

                 The target and observer define a state vector whose
                 position component points from the observer to the
                 target.

     ET          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000
                 TDB, at which the state of the target body relative to
                 the observer is to be computed. ET refers to time at
                 the observer's location.

     REF         is the name of the reference frame relative to which
                 the output state vector should be expressed. This may
                 be any frame supported by the SPICE system, including
                 built-in frames (documented in the Frames Required
                 Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel
                 (FK).

                 When REF designates a non-inertial frame, the
                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
                 dependent on the selected aberration correction.
                 See the description of the output state vector STARG
                 for details.

     ABCORR      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                 to the state of the target body to account for one-way
                 light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion
                 in the Particulars section for recommendations on
                 how to choose aberration corrections.

                 ABCORR may be any of the following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                               geometric state of the target body
                               relative to the observer.

                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the state of the target at the
                               moment it emitted photons arriving at
                               the observer at ET.

                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation (see Particulars for details).
                               The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                               uses one iteration.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The result is the apparent
                               state of the target---the position and
                               velocity of the target as seen by the
                               observer.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges (three
                               iterations on all supported platforms).
                               Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                               substantially more accurate than the
                               'LT' solution depends on the geometry
                               of the participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed. See the Particulars section
                               below for a discussion of precision of
                               light time corrections.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction and stellar aberration
                               correction.


                 The following values of ABCORR apply to the
                 &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
                 the observer's location at ET and arrive at the
                 target's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET+LT:

                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This correction yields the
                               state of the target at the moment it
                               receives photons emitted from the
                               observer's location at ET.

                    'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                               one-way light time and stellar
                               aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation  This option modifies the
                               state obtained with the 'XLT' option to
                               account for the observer's velocity
                               relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. The position component of
                               the computed target state indicates the
                               direction that photons emitted from the
                               observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to
                               hit the target.

                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction.

                    'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                               Newtonian light time correction and
                               stellar aberration correction.


                 Neither special nor general relativistic effects are
                 accounted for in the aberration corrections applied
                 by this routine.

                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 ABCORR.

     OBS         is the name of an observing body. Optionally, you
                 may supply the ID code of the object as an integer
                 string. For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are
                 legitimate strings to supply to indicate the
                 observer is Earth.

<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>

     STARG       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position
                 and velocity of the target body relative to the
                 specified observer. STARG is corrected for the
                 specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect
                 to the reference frame specified by REF. The first
                 three components of STARG represent the x-, y- and
                 z-components of the target's position; the last three
                 components form the corresponding velocity vector.

                 The position component of STARG points from the
                 observer's location at ET to the aberration-corrected
                 location of the target. Note that the sense of the
                 position vector is independent of the direction of
                 radiation travel implied by the aberration
                 correction.

                 The velocity component of STARG is the derivative
                 with respect to time of the position component of
                 STARG.

                 Units are always km and km/sec.

                 Non-inertial frames are treated as follows: letting
                 LTCENT be the one-way light time between the observer
                 and the central body associated with the frame, the
                 orientation of the frame is evaluated at ET-LTCENT,
                 ET+LTCENT, or ET depending on whether the requested
                 aberration correction is, respectively, for received
                 radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
                 LTCENT is computed using the method indicated by
                 ABCORR.

     LT          is the one-way light time between the observer and
                 target in seconds. If the target state is corrected
                 for aberrations, then LT is the one-way light time
                 between the observer and the light time corrected
                 target location.

     3) If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to
        compute the requested state vector, the deficiency will
        be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     This routine computes states using SPK files that have been
     loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading
     interface routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>. See the routine <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and the SPK
     and KERNEL Required Reading for further information on loading
     (and unloading) kernels.

     If the output state STARG is to be expressed relative to a
     non-inertial frame, or if any of the ephemeris data used to
     compute STARG are expressed relative to a non-inertial frame in
     the SPK files providing those data, additional kernels may be
     needed to enable the reference frame transformations required to
     compute the state. Normally these additional kernels are PCK
     files or frame kernels. Any such kernels must already be loaded

    SPICELIB Version 4.1.1, 19-JAN-2016 (EDW)

       Example code replaced with a complete program and
       the corresponding output.

       Particulars updated to refer to Aberration Corrections
       Required Reading document.

    SPICELIB Version 4.1.0, 03-JUL-2014 (NJB) (BVS)

        Discussion of light time corrections was updated. Assertions
        that converged light time corrections are unlikely to be
        useful were removed.

     Last update was 19-SEP-2013 (BVS)

        Updated to save the input body names and ZZBODTRN state
        counters and to do name-ID conversions only if the counters
        have changed.

    SPICELIB Version 4.0.0, 27-DEC-2007 (NJB)

        This routine was upgraded to more accurately compute
        aberration-corrected velocity, and in particular, make it
        more consistent with observer-target positions.

        When light time corrections are used, the derivative of light
        time with respect to time is now accounted for in the
        computation of observer-target velocities. When the reference
        frame associated with the output state is time-dependent, the
        derivative of light time with respect to time is now accounted
        for in the computation of the rate of change of orientation of
        the reference frame.

        When stellar aberration corrections are used, velocities
        now reflect the rate of range of the stellar aberration
        correction.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.2, 20-OCT-2003 (EDW)

        Added mention that LT returns in seconds.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.1, 29-JUL-2003 (NJB) (CHA)

        Various minor header changes were made to improve clarity.

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 31-DEC-2001 (NJB)

        Updated to handle aberration corrections for transmission
        of radiation. Formerly, only the reception case was
        supported. The header was revised and expanded to explain
        the functionality of this routine in more detail.

    Spicelib Version 2.0.0, 21-FEB-1997 (WLT)

        Extended the functionality of the routine. Users may
        now entered the id code of an object as an ascii string
        and the string will be converted to the corresponding
        integer representation.

    Spicelib Version 1.1.0, 09-JUL-1996 (WLT)

        Corrected the description of LT in the Detailed Output
        section of the header.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0, 25-SEP-1995 (BVS)</PRE>
