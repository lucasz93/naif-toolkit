     METHOD   is a short string providing parameters defining
              the computation method to be used. In the syntax
              descriptions below, items delimited by brackets
              are optional.

              METHOD may be assigned the following values:

                 'NEAR POINT/ELLIPSOID'

                    The sub-solar point computation uses a triaxial
                    ellipsoid to model the surface of the target body.
                    The sub-solar point is defined as the nearest
                    point on the target relative to the sun.

                    The word &quot;NADIR&quot; may be substituted for the phrase
                    &quot;NEAR POINT&quot; in the string above. 

                    For backwards compatibility, the older syntax

                       'Near point: ellipsoid'

                    is accepted as well.


                 'INTERCEPT/ELLIPSOID'

                    The sub-solar point computation uses a triaxial
                    ellipsoid to model the surface of the target body.
                    The sub-solar point is defined as the target
                    surface intercept of the line containing the sun
                    and the target's center.

                    For backwards compatibility, the older syntax

                       'Intercept: ellipsoid'

                    is accepted as well.


                 'NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                    The sub-solar point computation uses DSK data to
                    model the surface of the target body. The
                    sub-solar point is defined as the intercept, on
                    the surface represented by the DSK data, of the
                    line containing the sun and the nearest point on
                    the target's reference ellipsoid. If multiple such
                    intercepts exist, the one closest to the sun is
                    selected.

                    Note that this definition of the sub-solar point
                    is not equivalent to the &quot;nearest point on the
                    surface to the sun.&quot;  The phrase &quot;NEAR POINT&quot; may
                    NOT be substituted for &quot;NADIR&quot; in the string
                    above.

                    The surface list specification is optional. The
                    syntax of the list is

                       &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                    If present, it indicates that data only for the
                    listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                    need not be available for all surfaces in the
                    list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                    associated with the target body are used.

                    The surface list may contain surface names or
                    surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                    be delimited by double quotes, for example

                       SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                    If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                    or IDs must be separated by commas.

                    See the Particulars section below for details
                    concerning use of DSK data.


                 'INTERCEPT/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = 
                                              &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                    The sub-solar point computation uses DSK data to
                    model the surface of the target body. The
                    sub-solar point is defined as the target surface
                    intercept of the line containing the sun and the
                    target's center.

                    If multiple such intercepts exist, the one closest
                    to the sun is selected.

                    The surface list specification is optional. The
                    syntax of the list is identical to that for the
                    NADIR option described above.


                 Neither case nor white space are significant in
                 METHOD, except within double-quoted strings. For
                 example, the string ' eLLipsoid/nearpoint ' is valid.

                 Within double-quoted strings, blank characters are
                 significant, but multiple consecutive blanks are
                 considered equivalent to a single blank. Case is 
                 not significant. So

                    &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                 is equivalent to 

                    &quot; mars megdr  128  pixel/deg &quot;

                 but not to

                    &quot;MARS MEGDR128PIXEL/DEG&quot;

                 
     TARGET      is the name of the target body. The target body is 
                 an ephemeris object (its trajectory is given by
                 SPK data), and is an extended object.

                 The string TARGET is case-insensitive, and leading
                 and trailing blanks in TARGET are not significant.
                 Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
                 integer ID code for the object. For example both
                 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
                 the Moon is the target body.

                 When the target body's surface is represented by a
                 tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a
                 kernel variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is
                 present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel
                 variable would be defined by loading a PCK file.


     ET          is the epoch of participation of the observer,
                 expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: ET is
                 the epoch at which the observer's state is computed.

                 When aberration corrections are not used, ET is also
                 the epoch at which the position and orientation of
                 the target body and the position of the Sun are
                 computed.

                 When aberration corrections are used, ET is the epoch
                 at which the observer's state relative to the solar
                 system barycenter is computed; in this case the
                 position and orientation of the target body are
                 computed at ET-LT, where LT is the one-way light time
                 between the sub-solar point and the observer. See the
                 description of ABCORR below for details.


     FIXREF      is the name of a body-fixed reference frame centered
                 on the target body. FIXREF may be any such frame
                 supported by the SPICE system, including built-in
                 frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading)
                 and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK). The
                 string FIXREF is case-insensitive, and leading and
                 trailing blanks in FIXREF are not significant.

                 The output sub-solar point SPOINT and the
                 observer-to-sub-solar point vector SRFVEC will be
                 expressed relative to this reference frame.

                 
     ABCORR      indicates the aberration correction to be applied
                 when computing the target position and orientation
                 and the position of the Sun.

                 For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                 sub-solar point seen by the observer is desired,
                 normally either of the corrections
              
                    'LT+S' 
                    'CN+S'
     
                 should be used. These and the other supported options
                 are described below. ABCORR may be any of the 
                 following:

                    'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                               geometric sub-solar point on the target
                               body.

                 Let LT represent the one-way light time between the
                 observer and the sub-solar point (note: NOT between
                 the observer and the target body's center). The
                 following values of ABCORR apply to the &quot;reception&quot;
                 case in which photons depart from the sub-solar
                 point's location at the light-time corrected epoch
                 ET-LT and *arrive* at the observer's location at ET:

                    'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                               called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                               Newtonian formulation. This correction
                               yields the location of sub-solar
                               point at the moment it emitted photons
                               arriving at the observer at ET.
 
                               The light time correction uses an
                               iterative solution of the light time
                               equation. The solution invoked by the
                               'LT' option uses one iteration.

                               The target position and orientation as
                               seen by the observer are corrected for
                               light time. The position of the Sun
                               relative to the target is corrected for
                               one-way light time between the Sun and
                               target.

                    'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                               stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                               formulation. This option modifies the
                               sub-solar point obtained with the 'LT'
                               option to account for the observer's
                               velocity relative to the solar system
                               barycenter. These corrections yield
                               the apparent sub-solar point.

                    'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                               correction. In solving the light time
                               equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                               until the solution converges. Both the
                               position and rotation of the target
                               body, and the position of the Sun, are
                               corrected for light time.

                    'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time and
                               stellar aberration corrections. This
                               option produces a solution that is at
                               least as accurate at that obtainable
                               with the 'LT+S' option. Whether the
                               'CN+S' solution is substantially more
                               accurate depends on the geometry of the
                               participating objects and on the
                               accuracy of the input data. In all
                               cases this routine will execute more
                               slowly when a converged solution is
                               computed.

                 Neither case nor white space are significant in
                 ABCORR. For example, the string 

                   'Lt + s'

                 is valid.


     OBSRVR      is the name of the observing body. The observing body
                 is an ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft,
                 the earth, or a surface point on the earth. OBSRVR is
                 case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
                 OBSRVR are not significant. Optionally, you may
                 supply a string containing the integer ID code for
                 the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
                 legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
                 observer.

                 The observer may coincide with the target.

     SPOINT      is the sub-solar point on the target body. 

                 For target shapes modeled by ellipsoids, the
                 sub-solar point is defined either as the point on the
                 target body that is closest to the sun, or the target
                 surface intercept of the line from the sun to the
                 target's center.

                 For target shapes modeled by topographic data
                 provided by DSK files, the sub-solar point is defined
                 as the target surface intercept of the line from the
                 sun to either the nearest point on the reference
                 ellipsoid, or to the target's center. If multiple
                 such intercepts exist, the one closest to the sun is
                 selected.

                 The input argument METHOD selects the target shape
                 model and sub-solar point definition to be used.
 
                 SPOINT is expressed in Cartesian coordinates,
                 relative to the body-fixed target frame designated by
                 FIXREF. The body-fixed target frame is evaluated at
                 the sub-solar point epoch TRGEPC (see description
                 below).

                 When aberration corrections are used, SPOINT is
                 computed using target body position and orientation
                 that have been adjusted for the corrections
                 applicable to SPOINT itself rather than to the target
                 body's center. In particular, if the stellar
                 aberration correction applicable to SPOINT is
                 represented by a shift vector S, then the light-time
                 corrected position of the target is shifted by S
                 before the sub-solar point is computed.
                 
                 The components of SPOINT have units of km.


     TRGEPC      is the &quot;sub-solar point epoch.&quot; TRGEPC is defined as
                 follows: letting LT be the one-way light time between
                 the observer and the sub-solar point, TRGEPC is
                 either the epoch ET-LT or ET depending on whether the
                 requested aberration correction is, respectively, for
                 received radiation or omitted. LT is computed using
                 the method indicated by ABCORR.

                 TRGEPC is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.


     SRFVEC      is the vector from the observer's position at ET to
                 the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
                 position of SPOINT, where the aberration corrections
                 are specified by ABCORR. SRFVEC is expressed in the
                 target body-fixed reference frame designated by
                 FIXREF, evaluated at TRGEPC.
 
                 The components of SRFVEC are given in units of km.

                 One can use the SPICELIB function <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> to obtain the
                 distance between the observer and SPOINT:

                    DIST = <a href="vnorm.html">VNORM</a> ( SRFVEC )

                 The observer's position OBSPOS, relative to the
                 target body's center, where the center's position is
                 corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
                 ABCORR, can be computed via the call:

                    CALL <a href="vsub.html">VSUB</a> ( SPOINT, SRFVEC, OBSPOS )

                 To transform the vector SRFVEC from a reference frame
                 FIXREF at time TRGEPC to a time-dependent reference
                 frame REF at time ET, the routine <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> should be
                 called. Let XFORM be the 3x3 matrix representing the
                 rotation from the reference frame FIXREF at time
                 TRGEPC to the reference frame REF at time ET. Then
                 SRFVEC can be transformed to the result REFVEC as
                 follows:

                     CALL <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> ( FIXREF, REF,    TRGEPC, ET, XFORM )

     1)  If the specified aberration correction is unrecognized, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

         If transmission aberration corrections are specified, the
         error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled.

     2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be
         converted to an integer ID code, the error
         SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND) is signaled.

     3)  If the input target body-fixed frame FIXREF is not
         recognized, the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame
         name may fail to be recognized because a required frame
         specification kernel has not been loaded; another cause is a
         misspelling of the frame name.

     4)  If the input frame FIXREF is not centered at the target body,
         the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled.

     5)  If the input argument METHOD is not recognized, the error
         SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled by this routine, or the
         error is diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this
         routine.

         If the sub-solar point type is not specified or is not
         recognized, the error SPICE(INVALIDSUBTYPE) is signaled.

     6)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to
         calling <b>SUBSLR</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a
         routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when
         light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data must
         be available to propagate the states of observer, target, and
         the Sun to the solar system barycenter.

     7)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target
         shape and triaxial radii of the target body have not been
         loaded into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>SUBSLR</b>, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
         tree of this routine.

     8)  The target must be an extended body, and must have a shape
         for which a sub-solar point can be defined.

         If the target body's shape is modeled as an ellipsoid, and if
         any of the radii of the target body are non-positive, the
         error will be diagnosed and signaled by routines in the call
         tree of this routine.

         If the target body's shape is modeled by DSK data, the shape
         must be such that the specified sub-solar point definition is
         applicable. For example, if the target shape is a torus, both
         the NADIR and INTERCEPT definitions might be inapplicable,
         depending on the relative locations of the sun and target.

     9)  If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame
         orientation have not been loaded prior to calling <b>SUBSLR</b>,
         the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     10) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented by
         DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for the specified
         target, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     12) If METHOD specifies that the target surface is represented
         by DSK data, and the ray from the observer to the
         sub-observer point doesn't intersect the target body's
         surface, the error SPICE(SUBPOINTNOTFOUND) will be signaled.

     13) In some very rare cases, the surface intercept on the 
         target body's reference ellipsoid of the observer to target
         center vector may not be computable. In these cases the
         error SPICE(DEGENERATECASE) is signaled.

     14) If the target body is the sun, the error SPICE(INVALIDTARGET)
         is signaled.

     Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
     this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: ephemeris data for target, observer, and Sun must
          be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
          target, observer, and the Sun relative to the solar system
          barycenter must be calculable from the available ephemeris
          data. Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading
          one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be
          loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.

        - Shape data for the target body:
                
            PCK data: 

               If the target body shape is modeled as an ellipsoid,
               triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded into
               the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
               text PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

               Triaxial radii are also needed if the target shape is
               modeled by DSK data, but the DSK NADIR method is
               selected.

            DSK data: 

               If the target shape is modeled by DSK data, DSK files
               containing topographic data for the target body must be
               loaded. If a surface list is specified, data for at
               least one of the listed surfaces must be loaded.

     The following data may be required:

        - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the
          observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the
          target, that definition must be available in the kernel
          pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
          frame kernel via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
          in METHOD, the association of these names with their
          corresponding surface ID codes must be established by 
          assignments of the kernel variables

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

          Normally these associations are made by loading a text
          kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
          of such an assignment is

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1                    
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499                    

     In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
     run, NOT every time this routine is called.

<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>

     There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar
     point: &quot;nearest point on target to the Sun&quot; or &quot;target surface
     intercept of the line containing the Sun and target.&quot; These
     coincide when the target is spherical and generally are distinct
     otherwise.

     This routine computes light time corrections using light time
     between the observer and the sub-solar point, as opposed to the
     center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration corrections
     done by this routine are based on the direction of the vector
     from the observer to the light-time corrected sub-solar point,
     not to the target center. This technique avoids errors due to the
     differential between aberration corrections across the target
     body. Therefore it's valid to use aberration corrections with
     this routine even when the observer is very close to the
     sub-solar point, in particular when the observer to sub-solar
     point distance is much less than the observer to target center
     distance.
     
     When comparing sub-solar point computations with results from
     sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same
     geometric definitions are used.


     Using DSK data
     ==============

        DSK loading and unloading
        -------------------------

        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
        calling <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload.html">UNLOAD</a> or
        <a href="kclear.html">KCLEAR</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> for limits on numbers
        of loaded DSK files.

        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
        given body have different surface ID codes.


        DSK data priority
        -----------------

        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
        intervals of the segments overlap as well.

        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
        segment located closer to the end of the file takes
        precedence.

        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the
        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
        surface. 

        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
        required in the METHOD argument.

        
        Syntax of the METHOD input argument
        -----------------------------------

        The keywords and surface list in the METHOD argument
        are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any
        order, for example

           NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;
           DSK/NADIR/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED
           UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK/NADIR

        The simplest form of the METHOD argument specifying use of
        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

           'NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'
           'INTERCEPT/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
        segments, the above strings suffice. This is expected to be
        the usual case.

        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
        surfaces are to be used together.

        The surface list consists of the string

           SURFACES =

        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
        names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

           Surface Name                              ID code
           ------------                              -------
           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1
           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2
           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3

        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
        data for surface 1 can be specified by either

           'SURFACES = 1'

        or

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
        it contains blank characters. 
           
        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
        of the following surface lists could be used:

           'SURFACES = 2, 3'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'
         
        An example of a METHOD argument that could be constructed
        using one of the surface lists above is

        'NADIR/DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES= &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;,3'

         
        Aberration corrections
        ----------------------

        For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the
        observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a
        continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time
        between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as
        well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found
        using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at
        all. In all cases, the light time computation will terminate,
        but the result may be less accurate than expected.

     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
     the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
     arithmetic implementation.


     1) Find the sub-solar point on Mars as seen from the Earth for a
        specified time. 

        Compute the sub-solar point using both triaxial ellipsoid
        and topographic surface models. Topography data are provided by
        a DSK file. For the ellipsoid model, use both the &quot;intercept&quot;
        and &quot;near point&quot; sub-observer point definitions; for the DSK
        case, use both the &quot;intercept&quot; and &quot;nadir&quot; definitions.

        Display the locations of both the sun and the sub-solar
        point relative to the center of Mars, in the IAU_MARS
        body-fixed reference frame, using both planetocentric and
        planetographic coordinates.

        The topographic model is based on data from the MGS MOLA DEM
        megr90n000cb, which has a resolution of 4 pixels/degree. A
        triangular plate model was produced by computing a 720 x 1440
        grid of interpolated heights from this DEM, then tessellating
        the height grid. The plate model is stored in a type 2 segment
        in the referenced DSK file.

        Use the meta-kernel shown below to load the required SPICE

    SPICELIB Version 3.0.0, 04-APR-2017 (NJB)

        Added <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> tests.

       14-JUL-2016 (NJB)

        Now uses surface mapping tracking capability.
        Updated header.

       09-FEB-2015 (NJB) 
 
        Support for surface specification was added. 
        Header was updated to document DSK features.
      
       24-DEC-2014 (NJB) 

        Updated to support DSK data.

    SPICELIB Version 2.0.0, 31-MAR-2014 (NJB) (SCK) (BVS)

        Bug fix: stellar aberration is no longer applied to the
        observer-to-estimated sub-solar point vector while solving for
        the sub-solar point. This correction involved unnecessary code
        but did not affect this routine's outputs.

        Bug fix: FIRST is now set to .FALSE. at the completion of a
        successful initialization pass. This does not affect the
        routine's outputs but improves efficiency.

        Exceptions removed: the observer and target are now 
        permitted to coincide.

        Upgrade: the algorithm for finding the apparent state of the
        sun as seen from the estimated sub-solar point has been
        improved.

        Upgrade: this routine now uses ZZVALCOR rather than ZZPRSCOR,
        simplifying the implementation.

        The header example program was updated to reflect the new
        method of computing the apparent sun location, and the set
        of kernels referenced by the example meta-kernel were updated.
        The display of the program's output was updated accordingly.

        References to the new <a href="pxfrm2.html">PXFRM2</a> routine were added, which changed
        the Detailed Output section.

        Updated to save the input body names and ZZBODTRN state
        counters and to do name-ID conversions only if the counters
        have changed.

        Updated to save the input frame name and <a href="pool.html">POOL</a> state counter
        and to do frame name-ID conversion only if the counter has
        changed.

        Updated to call <a href="ljucrs.html">LJUCRS</a> instead of <a href="cmprss.html">CMPRSS</a>/<a href="ucase.html">UCASE</a>. 

    SPICELIB Version 1.1.0, 18-MAY-2010 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: calls to <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a>() have been added after
        SPK calls, target radius lookup, near point
        and surface intercept computations.

    SPICELIB Version 1.0.1, 17-MAR-2009 (NJB) 

        Typo correction: changed FIXFRM to FIXREF in header
        documentation. Meta-kernel name suffix was changed to
        &quot;.tm&quot; in header code example.

        Typo correction in Required_Reading, changed 
        FRAME to FRAMES.
