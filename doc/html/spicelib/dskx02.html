     HANDLE     is the file handle of a DSK file containing a shape
                model for a target body.  The shape model is stored
                in a type 2 DSK segment.
   
     DLADSC     is the DLA descriptor of a type 2 DSK segment
                containing plate model data representing the surface of
                the target body.  The caller should declare DLADSC
                with size DLADSZ; this size parameter is defined in
                the INCLUDE file dla.inc.  Normally this descriptor
                will be obtained by a search through a DSK file
                using the DLA search routines; see the Examples
                header section below for a working code example
                illustrating a simple search.

     VERTEX     is the vertex of a ray.  VERTEX is expressed relative
                to the body fixed reference frame associated with the
                target body.  This reference frame is the same frame
                relative to which the vertices of the plate model
                are expressed.  Units are km.

                The vertex is required to be outside the target
                body.

     RAYDIR     is the ray's direction vector.  RAYDIR is expressed
                relative to the body fixed reference frame associated
                with the target body.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
     PLID       is the ID of the plate closest to the input ray's
                vertex at which a ray-surface intercept exists.
                If no intercept exists, PLID is undefined.

     XPT        is the ray-target intercept closest to the ray's
                vertex, if an intercept exists.  XPT is expressed
                relative to the body-fixed reference frame associated
                with the target body.  Units are km.

                If no intercept exists, XPT is undefined.

     FOUND      is a logical flag that indicates whether or not the
                ray does indeed intersect the target.  If the ray
                intersects a plate FOUND is .TRUE.  Otherwise FOUND is
                FALSE.

     1)  If the input handle is invalid, the error will be diagnosed by
         routines in the call tree of this routine.

     2)  If a file read error occurs, the error will be diagnosed by
         routines in the call tree of this routine.

     3)  If the input DLA descriptor is invalid, the effect of this
         routine is undefined. The error *may* be diagnosed by routines
         in the call  tree of this routine, but there are no
         guarantees.

     4)  If an error occurs while trying to look up any component
         of the shape model, the error will be diagnosed by routines
         in the call tree of this routine.

     5)  If the input ray direction is the zero vector, the error
         SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) is signaled.

     6)  If the coarse voxel grid scale of the shape model is less than
         1, the error SPICE(VALUEOUTOFRANGE) is signaled.
    
     7)  If the coarse voxel grid of the shape model contains more
         than MAXCGR (see pltmax.inc) voxels, the error
         SPICE(GRIDTOOLARGE) is signaled.

     8)  If the plate list for any intersected voxel is too large
         for this routine to buffer, the error SPICE(ARRAYTOOSMALL)
         is signaled.

     9)  Due to round-off errors, results from this routine may
         differ across platforms.  Results also may differ from
         those expected---and not necessarily by a small amount.
         For example, a ray may miss a plate it was expected to
         hit and instead hit another plate considerably farther
         from the ray's vertex, or miss the target entirely.

     10) In the event that an intercept point lies on multiple 
         plates (that is, the point is on an edge or vertex), 
         a plate will be selected.  Due to round-off error, the
         selection may vary across platforms.

     This routine solves the ray-surface intercept problem for 
     a specified ray and a surface represented by triangular plate 
     model.  The surface representation is provided by data in a
     type 2 segment of a DSK file.

     This routine does not assume that the segment from which the
     surface model data are read represents the entire surface of
     the target body.  A program could call this routine repeatedly
     to find the surface intercept of a ray and a shape model
     partitioned into multiple segments.

     In general, this routine should be expected to run faster
     when used with smaller shape models.  
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Examples">Examples</a></h4>
<PRE>
     The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
     platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input,
     the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine specific
     arithmetic implementation.

     1) Find the surface intercept points corresponding to a latitude/
        longitude grid of a specified resolution, for a specified
        target body.  This simple program assumes the shape model for
        the target body is stored in a single type 2 DSK segment, and
        that this segment is the first one in the DSK file to which it
        belongs.

        In the following example program, the file

           phobos_3_3.bds

        is a DSK file containing a type 2 segment that provides a
        plate model representation of the surface of Phobos. In order
        to duplicate the example output, this kernel name should be
        supplied at the prompt.

<h4><a name="Version">Version</a></h4>
<PRE>
    SPICELIB Version 1.0.0 04-APR-2017 (NJB) 

        Added test for containment of intersection point
        within segment boundaries. Updated logic for saving
        segment attributes so that errors won't cause saved
        values to be improperly re-used on subsequent calls.

     24-FEB-2016 (NJB) 

        Replaced call to TOGRID with call to ZZTOGRID.
        Replaced call to PLTREC with call to <a href="pltnrm.html">PLTNRM</a>.
        Now obtains plate expansion fraction from <a href="dskgtl.html">DSKGTL</a>.

     25-FEB-2015 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: now ray-voxel grid intercept is displaced toward
        the input ray's vertex only when the vertex is outside
        the target body's voxel grid.

     10-SEP-2014 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: during an intercept search over the voxel list
        returned by <a href="xdda.html">XDDA</a>, if an intercept outside the current
        voxel---by more than a small tolerance---is found, the search
        rejects that intercept and continues until a valid intercept
        is found and all plates in the voxel containing that intercept
        have been checked for an intersection. The rejected intercept
        may later be determined to be a valid solution during a check
        of plates associated with a voxel that contains that
        intercept; in fact it is the correct solution if no other
        plates contain a solution closer to the ray's vertex. (Usually
        there is a unique voxel containing the intercept, but this is
        not so if the intercept lies on a voxel boundary not on an
        edge of the voxel grid.)

        Note that there's no need to look for intersections in voxels
        further out in the voxel list than the first one that contains
        an intercept.

        The previous version of the routine terminated the search
        after checking all plates in the current voxel, after an
        intercept was found on any plate associated with that voxel.
        The intercept was not required to be contained in the voxel.

        See the Revisions section for details.

     30-JUN-2014 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: renamed &quot;found&quot; flag returned by ZZRAYBOX.

        Added code to test for empty voxel list after
        voxel list compression.

        Last update was 15-JUN-2014 (NJB).

        Made some minor edits to in-line comments, and removed
        comments that had become inapplicable due to code changes.

        Last update was 06-JUN-2014.

        Now expands plates slightly before performing ray-plate
        intersection computations.

        Bug fix: now calls ZZRAYBOX to find the ray-box intercept.
        This reduces round-off error in the variable COORD.

       Last update was 02-MAY-2014 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: added <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> checks after each <a href="dski02.html">DSKI02</a> and <a href="dskd02.html">DSKD02</a>
        call.

        Some precautionary measures were added: a backstop check for
        an empty voxel list was added after the <a href="xdda.html">XDDA</a> call. A backstop
        initialization of PNTR was added before the plate collection
        loop. This initialization is needed only if the voxel list
        returned by <a href="xdda.html">XDDA</a> is empty. The list should never be empty.
       
        Last update was 2.2.1 25-MAR-2014 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: duplicate plates are now marked so that the
        unmarked instance is the one in the closest voxel to
        the ray's origin.

        Bug fix: corrected buffer overflow error detection for
        insertion of plate IDs into plate ID array.

     20-JUL-2011 (NJB) 

        Bug fix: this routine now tests <a href="failed.html">FAILED</a> after its
        call to <a href="xdda.html">XDDA</a>.

        Header correction: the detailed input section
        now says that the ray's vertex *is* required to
        be outside the target body.

     09-JUN-2011 (NJB) 

        All large local arrays are now saved in order to support
        calling a C translation of this routine from Java.

        The buffer VIDXS is now initialized prior to its
        first use in an argument list. This was done to 
        to suppress compiler warnings. The original code was
        correct, since along with the buffer, an array size
        of zero was passed to the called function.

        The example program was updated for compatibility with the
        final DSK descriptor layout. The output format was adjusted.
        Sample output from the program is now shown in the header.

     13-MAY-2010 (NJB) 

        No longer uses plate records to weed out 
        plates prior to ray-plate intercept tests.
        Now uses local vertex buffer. Logic for choosing
        plate when intercept is on edge or vertex has
        been simplified.

     06-MAY-2010 (NJB) 

        Now calls <a href="dskb02.html">DSKB02</a> rather than <a href="dskp02.html">DSKP02</a>.

     20-APR-2010 (NJB) 

        Updated header section order.

     26-SEP-2008 (NJB) 

        Moved OBSMAT computation out of loop.

     27-DEC-2006 (NJB) (EDW)

        Header example was updated to show maximum radius
        being obtained from DSK descriptor rather than via
        all to <a href="dskd02.html">DSKD02</a>.

     31-OCT-2006 (NJB) (EDW)

        Modified to work with DLA-based kernels.  Many
        changes were made to the algorithm to improve
        execution speed.

     19-AUG-2004 (EDW)

        Implemented &quot;Fast Ray-Box Intersection&quot; algorithm.
        Renamed routine <b>DSKX02</b> from PLBORE_3.

     25-FEB-1999 (JAB)

        Based on PLBORE and PLBORE_2.</PRE>
