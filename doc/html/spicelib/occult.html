     TARG1      is the name of the first target body. Both object
                names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For example, both
                'Moon' and '301' are accepted.

     SHAPE1     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                represent the shape of the first target body. The
                supported options are:

                   'ELLIPSOID'    

                       Use a triaxial ellipsoid model with radius
                       values provided via the kernel pool. A kernel
                       variable having a name of the form

                          'BODYnnn_RADII'

                       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code
                       associated with the body, must be present in
                       the kernel pool. This variable must be
                       associated with three numeric values giving the
                       lengths of the ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z
                       semi-axes.

                   'POINT'       

                       Treat the body as a single point. When a point
                       target is specified, the occultation conditions
                       can only be total, annular, or none.

                   'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                       Use topographic data provided by DSK files to
                       model the body's shape. These data must be
                       provided by loaded DSK files.

                       The surface list specification is optional. The
                       syntax of the list is

                          &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                       If present, it indicates that data only for the
                       listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                       need not be available for all surfaces in the
                       list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                       associated with the target body are used.

                       The surface list may contain surface names or
                       surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                       be delimited by double quotes, for example

                          SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;
                                         
                       If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                       or IDs must be separated by commas.

                       See the Particulars section below for details
                       concerning use of DSK data.

                The combinations of the shapes of the target bodies
                TARG1 and TARG2 must be one of:

                   One ELLIPSOID, one POINT
                   Two ELLIPSOIDs
                   One DSK, one POINT

                Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                significant in the string SHAPE1.

     FRAME1     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                frame associated with the first target body. Examples
                of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
                'ITRF93' (for the Earth).

                If the first target body is modeled as a point, FRAME1
                should be left blank (Ex: ' ').

                Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.

     TARG2      is the name of the second target body. See the
                description of TARG1 above for more details.

     SHAPE2     is the shape specification for the body designated
                by TARG2. See the description of SHAPE1 above for
                details.

     FRAME2     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                frame associated with the second target body. See the
                description of FRAME1 above for more details.

     ABCORR     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                the state of each target body to account for one-way
                light time. Stellar aberration corrections are
                ignored if specified, since these corrections don't
                improve the accuracy of the occultation determination.

                See the header of the SPICE routine <a href="spkezr.html">SPKEZR</a> for a
                detailed description of the aberration correction
                options. For convenience, the options supported by
                this routine are listed below:

                   'NONE'     Apply no correction.   

                   'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                              one-way light time using a Newtonian
                              formulation.

                   'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                              Newtonian light time correction.

                   'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                              one-way light time using a Newtonian
                              formulation.

                   'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                              Newtonian light time correction.

                Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                ABCORR.

     OBSRVR     is the name of the body from which the occultation
                is observed. See the description of TARG1 above for
                more details.

     ET         is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
                epoch.

     OCLTID     is an integer occultation code indicating the geometric
                relationship of the three bodies.  

                The meaning of the sign of OCLTID is given below.

                    Code sign          Meaning
                    ---------          ------------------------------
                       &gt; 0             The second target is
                                       partially or fully occulted
                                       by the first.

                       &lt; 0             The first target is 
                                       partially of fully
                                       occulted by the second.

                       = 0             No occultation.

                Possible OCLTID values and meanings are given below.
                The variable names indicate the type of occultation
                and which target is in the back. For example, TOTAL1
                represents a total occultation in which the first
                target is in the back of (or is occulted by) the
                second target.

                When the target shapes are DSK and POINT, the only
                possible occultation conditions are total, annular,
                or none.

                    Name      Code     Meaning
                    ------    -----    ------------------------------
                    TOTAL1     -3      Total occultation of first
                                       target by second.

                    ANNLR1     -2      Annular occultation of first
                                       target by second. If the second
                                       target shape is an ellipsoid,
                                       it does not block the limb of
                                       the first.

                    PARTL1     -1      Partial occultation of first
                                       target by second target.

                    NOOCC       0      No occultation or transit: both
                                       objects are completely visible
                                       to the observer.

                    PARTL2      1      Partial occultation of second
                                       target by first target.

                    ANNLR2      2      Annular occultation of second
                                       target by first.

                    TOTAL2      3      Total occultation of second

     1)  If the target or observer body names input by the user are
         not recognized, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in
         the call tree of this routine.

     2)  If the input shapes are not accepted, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     3)  If both input shapes are points, the error will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     4)  If the radii of a target body modeled as an ellipsoid cannot
         be determined by searching the kernel pool for a kernel
         variable having a name of the form

            'BODYnnn_RADII' 

         where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with
         the body, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the
         call tree of this routine.

     5)  If any of the target or observer bodies (TARG1, TARG2, or
         OBSRVR) are the same, the error will be diagnosed
         by a routine in the call tree of this routine.
         
     6)  If the loaded kernels provide insufficient data to 
         compute any required state vector, the deficiency will
         be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     7)  If an error occurs while reading an SPK or other kernel,
         the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the call tree 
         of this routine.

     8)  Invalid aberration correction specifications will be
         diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

     17) If either SHAPE1 or SHAPE2 specifies that the target surface
         is represented by DSK data, and no DSK files are loaded for
         the specified target, the error is signaled by a routine in
         the call tree of this routine.

     18) If either SHAPE1 or SHAPE2 specifies that the target surface
         is represented by DSK data, but the shape specification is
         invalid, the error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
         of this routine.

     Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
     before this routine is called.

     The following data are required:

        - SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data
          for the target, source and observer that cover the time
          period specified by the window CNFINE. If aberration
          corrections are used, the states of the target bodies and of
          the observer relative to the solar system barycenter must be
          calculable from the available ephemeris data. Typically
          ephemeris data
          are made available by loading one or more SPK files via
          <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have
          semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool.
          Typically these data are made available by loading a text
          PCK file via <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a>.

        - FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by
          FRAME1 or FRAME2 are not built in to the SPICE system,
          one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded.

     The following data may be required:

        - DSK data: if either SHAPE1 or SHAPE2 indicates that DSK
          data are to be used, DSK files containing topographic data
          for the target body must be loaded. If a surface list is
          specified, data for at least one of the listed surfaces must
          be loaded.

        - Surface name-ID associations: if surface names are specified
          in SHAPE1 or SHAPE2, the association of these names with
          their corresponding surface ID codes must be established by
          assignments of the kernel variables

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY

          Normally these associations are made by loading a text
          kernel containing the necessary assignments. An example
          of such a set of assignments is

             NAIF_SURFACE_NAME += 'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'
             NAIF_SURFACE_CODE += 1
             NAIF_SURFACE_BODY += 499

        - CK data: either of the body-fixed frames to which FRAME1 or
          FRAME2 refer might be a CK frame. If so, at least one CK
          file will be needed to permit transformation of vectors
          between that frame and the J2000 frame.

        - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK
          kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK
          (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time
          (TDB).

     Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every
     time this routine is called.

     This routine supports the target shape combinations

        POINT     - ELLIPSOID
        POINT     - DSK
        ELLIPSOID - ELLIPSOID

     For many purposes, modeling extended bodies as triaxial
     ellipsoids is adequate for determining whether one body is
     occulted by another as seen from a specified observer.
     

     Using DSK data
     ==============

        DSK loading and unloading
        -------------------------

        DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
        calling <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="unload.html">UNLOAD</a> or
        <a href="kclear.html">KCLEAR</a>. See the documentation of <a href="furnsh.html">FURNSH</a> for limits on numbers
        of loaded DSK files.

        For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
        loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
        use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
        example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
        used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
        used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
        the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
        that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
        given body have different surface ID codes.


        DSK data priority
        -----------------

        A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
        files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
        given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
        intervals of the segments overlap as well.

        When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
        overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
        files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
        precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
        segment located closer to the end of the file takes
        precedence.

        When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
        segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
        both represent a surface as sets of triangular plates, the
        union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
        surface. 

        Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
        Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
        in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
        required in the SHAPE1 and SHAPE2 arguments.

        
        Syntax of the shape input arguments for the DSK case
        ----------------------------------------------------

        The keywords and surface list in the target shape arguments
        SHAPE1 and SHAPE2, when DSK shape models are specified, are
        called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any order, for
        example

           DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED
           DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;
           UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK

        The simplest form of a target argument specifying use of
        DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

           'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

        For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
        body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
        segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
        the usual case.

        When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
        files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
        surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
        specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
        surfaces are to be used together.

        The surface list consists of the string

           SURFACES =

        followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
        identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
        string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
        names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

           Surface Name                              ID code
           ------------                              -------
           'Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG'                1
           'Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG'                 2
           'Mars_MRO_HIRISE'                         3

        If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
        data for surface 1 can be specified by either

           'SURFACES = 1'

        or

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

        Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name because
        it contains blank characters. 
           
        To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
        of the following surface lists could be used:

           'SURFACES = 2, 3'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

           'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

           'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'
                  
        An example of a shape argument that could be constructed
        using one of the surface lists above is

              'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = '
           // '&quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 499003'
